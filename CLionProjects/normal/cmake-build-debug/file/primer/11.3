Bidirectional and random access iterators have corresponding reverse
iterator adaptors that iterate through the data structure in the
opposite direction.  They have the same signatures as the corresponding
iterators.  The fundamental relation between a reverse %iterator and its
corresponding %iterator @c i is established by the identity:
@code
&*(reverse_iterator(i)) == &*(i - 1)
@endcode

   *  <em>This mapping is dictated by the fact that while there is always a
   *  pointer past the end of an array, there might not be a valid pointer
   *  before the beginning of an array.</em> [24.4.1]/1,2
   *
   *  Reverse iterators can be tricky and surprising at first.  Their
   *  semantics make sense, however, and the trickiness is a side effect of
   *  the requirement that the iterators must be safe.

176. Second Highest Salary
Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+


#sql // 排除最大值
select MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee WHERE salary NOT IN (select MAX(salary) FROM Employee)

#sql // 排序
select distinct salary AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee ORDER BY salary LIMIT 1, 1; // 如果数据不存在，这里返回的是空的，select NULL as col 就会出现了

select (select distinct salary from Employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1, 1) as SecondHighestSalary
